PROJECT TITLE : Continuous Target Shift Adaptation in Supervised Learning

SUMMARY:
The objective of is to estimate conditional density distribution under the target shift in semi supervised setup.

MOTIVATION:
It is traditionally assumed, in supervsed learning, that both training and test data follow same distriution.  However, this is often violated in real-time applications due to intrinsic non-stationarity of the environment.  This is usually known as data-set shift.  In this project we are considering target shift under supervised learning.  Where-in, target marginal distriution of the training and test data is different while target conditional covariate conditions are similar.   
 
REQUIREMENTS: 
MATLAB 2012 and above

DATASET FILE:  http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~ delve/


INSTRUCTIONS: 1) Open the main folder after getting the files from repo
	      2) Open the file named  "demo_TSCDE.m"(for toy example).
              4) For delve dataset "demo_TSCDE_dataset.m"  And run it.  
	      3) Wait for the graphs to get generated.
